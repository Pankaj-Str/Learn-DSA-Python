# Python - Data structures Alorithm Design

Computers store and process data with an extra ordinary speed and accuracy. So, it is highly essential that the data is stored efficiently and can be accessed fast. Also, the processing of data should happen in the smallest possible time, but without losing the accuracy.

Data structures deal with how the data is organised and held in the memory, when a program processes it. It is important to note that, the data that is stored in the disk as part of persistent storages (like relational tables) are not referred as data structure here.

An Algorithm is step by step set of instruction to process the data for a specific purpose. So, an algorithm utilises various data structures in a logical way to solve a specific computing problem.
