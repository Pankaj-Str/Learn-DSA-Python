# Algorithm justifications

Algorithm justifications in Python (or any other programming language) involve providing explanations and reasoning for the design choices made in developing an algorithm. These justifications aim to demonstrate the correctness, efficiency, and effectiveness of the algorithm for solving the given problem. Here are some common aspects to consider when justifying an algorithm in Python:

1. Correctness:
   - Explain how the algorithm ensures that it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
   - Provide mathematical proofs, invariants, or pre/post-conditions that guarantee the correctness of the algorithm.

2. Efficiency:
   - Analyze the time complexity of the algorithm to show how it scales with the input size.
   - Compare the time complexity with other algorithms to justify why the chosen algorithm is more efficient.
   - Discuss any optimizations made to improve the algorithm's performance.

3. Space Complexity:
   - Analyze the space complexity of the algorithm to understand how much memory it uses.
   - Explain any trade-offs made between time complexity and space complexity.

4. Comparison with Alternatives:
   - Compare the algorithm with other potential solutions to the problem.
   - Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen algorithm over alternative approaches.

5. Handling Edge Cases:
   - Explain how the algorithm handles edge cases and boundary conditions, ensuring it works correctly in all scenarios.

6. Proof of Optimality (if applicable):
   - If the algorithm solves a specific problem optimally (e.g., finding the shortest path), provide a proof of optimality.

7. Empirical Evidence:
   - If possible, present empirical evidence through experiments and test cases to show the algorithm's effectiveness and efficiency.

8. Real-World Use Cases:
   - Describe real-world scenarios or applications where the algorithm is well-suited and performs efficiently.

Remember that algorithm justifications are essential when designing algorithms for complex problems or when comparing different solutions. A well-justified algorithm instills confidence in its correctness and efficiency, allowing other developers to understand, use, and maintain the algorithm effectively. Additionally, justifications are useful for academic purposes when submitting research papers or proposing new algorithms to the scientific community.


### Example of a Python algorithm that checks if a given number is prime. We'll provide justifications for the correctness and efficiency of the algorithm.

```python
def is_prime(number):
    if number <= 1:
        return False

    for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False

    return True

# Test the is_prime function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = 17
    result = is_prime(num)
    print(f"{num} is prime: {result}")
```

Justifications:

1. Correctness:
   - The algorithm correctly handles edge cases by returning False for numbers less than or equal to 1, as they are not prime by definition.
   - The loop starts from 2 and iterates up to the square root of the number (int(number**0.5) + 1). This is because if the number has a divisor larger than its square root, it must also have a divisor smaller than the square root. Thus, checking up to the square root is sufficient to determine primality.
   - For each divisor i within the loop, if the number is divisible by i (number % i == 0), the algorithm returns False, indicating that the number is not prime.
   - If no divisors are found within the loop, the algorithm returns True, confirming that the number is prime.

2. Efficiency:
   - The time complexity of the algorithm is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the input number. This is because the loop iterates up to the square root of the number (int(number**0.5) + 1).
   - The algorithm is efficient for checking primality, especially for large numbers, as it only checks divisors up to the square root. This significantly reduces the number of divisors to check compared to a brute-force approach, which would check up to n.

In conclusion, the `is_prime` algorithm is correct and efficient for determining whether a given number is prime. Its time complexity scales well with the size of the input, making it suitable for practical use cases. The justifications provided above ensure that the algorithm behaves as expected and performs optimally for the problem of prime number checking.
